# Hero rest api

The projects backend is build in Express framework to Node.js. I also did an vanilla javascript frontend in the folder /public. But after our leasson about React i also did an react frontend in the folder /myreactfrontend. so now i have 2 frontends, but gave most of my time to the react frontend.

## Features

All features for G and VG is implemented in the solution. I also have good validation on the api so no bad data can be stored in my jsonDb file, and in my front end (both vanilla javascript and react frontend) i have validation so it matches the validation in my api to give an good user experience.


## How to run project

To run the project, simply run the server in the rot folder (hero-rest-api) with "npm start". in the server folder you have an file called server\server.http that you can test the calls to the api. Then to run the react frontend, open a new terminal and go to myreactfrontend and start it with npm start
